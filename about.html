    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a graduate student in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Dhaka, with a deep interest in how life operates at the molecular level.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my undergraduate studies, I explored various subfields of molecular biology, gaining hands-on experience in both wet-lab and in-silico research. I interned at the Clinical Biochemistry and Translational Medicine Lab, where I worked with PCR, RT-PCR, Western blotting, and computational tools to investigate molecular markers in disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iâ€™ve been involved in organizing and participating in scientific events and academic clubs, serving as General Secretary of Synapse and Joint Secretary of the Ekushey Debating Club. These experiences helped shape my leadership, communication, and collaboration skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      My future ambition is to pursue a PhD and contribute to cancer biology or immunology research while teaching and mentoring the next generation of scientists.
