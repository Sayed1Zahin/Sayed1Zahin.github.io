      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>
        I am a passionate student of molecular biology and biochemistry, currently pursuing my graduate studies at the University of Dhaka. My academic journey blends coursework, lab research, and project experienceâ€”from computational drug design to hands-on techniques like PCR and Western blotting.
